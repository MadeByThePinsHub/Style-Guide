This style guide is the home of writing documentation for both technical and non-technical documentation websites made by the Pins team. We want to have a one-stop place to make sure that any documentation we write, whatever that's [our handbook](https://en.handbooksbythepins.gq) or the [Community Lore](https://lores.recaptime.tk), follows strict and professional guidelines.
