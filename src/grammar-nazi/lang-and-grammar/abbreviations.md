# Abbreviations

## What not to use

* Prefer English terms over Latin abbreviations.
* Don't use _i.e._ or _e.g._; instead, use _that is_ or _for example_.
  * One exception: [it's okay to use _etc._ in some cirustances.](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#etc)
* Avoid using internet slang abbreviations, such as [RTFM](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#rtfm) and [ymmv](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#ymmv), as possible. Write out what you mean in a non-figurative way.
  * When using internet slang, please also use the full spelled-out form.
* Use the most common form of a word. If the full spelled-out word is common and easily understandable, use that rather than abbreviating. For example, write approximately instead of approx.
