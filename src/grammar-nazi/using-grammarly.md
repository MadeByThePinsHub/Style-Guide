# Using Grammarly

We at the Pins team use Grammarly to write professional-looking blog posts and team updates, even we're in the free plan \(it will be, soon\).

## Setup

1. **Sign up on the Grammarly website.** If you're using it, use your account. While we recommend having a separate account for work using an `@madebythepins.tk` address \(for contributors and CHN board members who don't have it, just forget it.\), we prefer to use your existing account if you're on a paid plan.
2. Make sure to change your Language Preference to American English. We follow American rules in our documentation.
