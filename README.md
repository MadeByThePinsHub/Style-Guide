# Style Guide
Style guide for The Pins Team documentation, including the public team handbook, and our Community Hubs Network.

## Building the docs

Our documentation is built on [GitBook](https://gitbook.com), so you need an GitBook account and an GitBook space to build the website.

To get things started:
* [Fork this repoisotry](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/Style-Guide/fork) to your personal GitHub account.
* Open `https://app.gitbook.com` in an new tab. Sign in if prompted.
* Go to your personal spaces (your profile pic). Click **Create a new space** and use `Style Guide (Dev) | The Pins Team` as the name of your new space. Hit **Create**
* Under **Integrations** tab, toggle GitHub intergation switch and sign-in with your personal GitHub account.
* When prompted, select your fork. To import existing content, choose GitHub to pull existing content into your newly-created space.
* Done. Happy editing!
